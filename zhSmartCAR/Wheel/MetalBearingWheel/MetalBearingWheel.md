# 1. Introduction

  In this document, we just present the installation steps for the T300 Tank chassis with the following steps, and the connection motors to the doit version NodeMCU kit. Here, we just take T300 as an example to show the steps, but this manual is also used to the other type of tank chassis.

# 2. Install the bearing wheel

## 2.1 Materials

The bearing wheel includes the following materials.

1)   17mm copper coupling: 3pcs; 

2)   M3*8 screw: 6pcs;

3)   Stainless steel connector: 1pcs;

4)   M2 screw: 1pcs;

5)   Bearing: 2pcs;

6)   WheelPiece: 2pcs. (Please align the **location holes** when installation).

which are shown in the following Figure.

## 2.6 Some notes for the installation of bearing wheel

1. Align the location holes for the two wheelpiece;
2. Donâ€™t let M2 srew connect the stainless steel connector too lighten.
3. When let the bearing insert into the stainless steel connector, maybe you should try hard.
